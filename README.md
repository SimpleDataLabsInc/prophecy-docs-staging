## Documentation Staging

When you create a PR in the `prophecy-docs` repo, that version of the documentation will be built on the `prophecy-docs-staging` repo in a subdirectory specific to your PR. 

GitHub automatically adds a link to the staging site as a comment when you open a PR.

The staging site might take 5+ minutes to incorporate your PR changes.
